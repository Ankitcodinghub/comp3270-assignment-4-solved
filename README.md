4. Think carefully; formulate your answers, and then write them out concisely using English, logic, mathematics and pseudocode (no programming language syntax).

1. (15 points) Binary Heap

Max-Heap-Increase-Key(A[1‚Ä¶n]: array of number, i: int 1‚â§i‚â§n, key)

1 if key &lt; A[i]

2 then print ‚Äúnew key is smaller than current key‚Äù

3 A[i] = key

4 parent = floor(i/2)

5 while i &gt; 1 and A[parent] &lt; A[i]

6 temp = A[i]

7 A[i]= A[parent]

8 A[parent] = temp

9 i = parent

10 parent = floor(i/2)

Show that the complexity of this algorithm is O(log2n)=O(lgn) by developing and stating its T(n) in which the largest n-term is a lgn term. Do this by filling in the table and blanks below. Some entries are prefilled. Cost of the floor operation = 1

Step# Cost of single execution Exact # of times executed Total cost of this step = column 1 * column 2

1 5 1 5

2 1 1 1

3 4 1 4

4 4 1 4

5 10 At most lgn + 1 times 10(lgn + 1)

6 4 At most lgn times 4lgn

7 6 At most lgn times 6lgn

8 4 At most lgn times 4lgn

9 2 At most lgn times 2lgn

10 4 At most lgn times 4lgn

Sum of last column: 5 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10(lgn + 1) + 4lgn + 6lgn + 4lgn + 2lgn + 4lgn = 24 + 30lgn

Sum the last column and simplify to obtain T(n) &lt; 24 + 30lgn

2. (14 points) Quick Sort

Come up with an input of size 7 that will:

10 30 20 40 50 60 35

70 60 50 40 30 20 10

3. (5 points) Counting Sort

The Counting Sort algorithm can be used to sort integers in the range i-j, i&lt;j and i&gt;0 by pre-processing the input array A so that the algorithm can be applied to it as is with no modifications and then postprocess the output array B to recover the original input in the sorted order. Explain in English what this will entail:

(a) What is the pre-processing on A that can be done so that the algorithm can work with no modifications?

Since the algorithm works for an array with input elements in the range from 0 to k for some integer k, the pre-processing on A would have to modify the elements in A to fit such a range. If array A originally has the range i ‚Äì j , i &lt; j and i &gt; 0 the pre-processing would include performing some operation on each element such that the new range was 0 ‚Äì k. One way to do this would be to subtract the smallest value in the array from every element. So if the array was [2, 5, 3, 4] (i = 2, j = 5), then the pre-processing would subtract 2 (the smallest element) from all elements in the array. The result would be [0, 3, 1, 2]. This array‚Äôs range is now 0 ‚Äì 3 and therefore fits the range specifications (0 ‚Äì k) for the algorithm.

(b) What is the value of k in this case (the algorithm requires prior knowledge of the input range 0-k)? The value of k would be the largest element in the array. After the pre-processing this value will be j ‚Äì i (the largest value from the initial range minus the smallest value from the initial range). (c) What is the post-processing on B that can be done so that the algorithm can work with no modifications?

Since pre-processing only involved subtracting the smallest element from the original array, all that must be done to get back the original array in sorted order is to add the value of i (the smallest element) back to the array.

4. (7 points) Radix Sort

If Radix Sort is used to sort an array of words alphabetically, and the input array is A=

CATS BATS BITS PINE DIG&lt; &gt; BORE DIM&lt; &gt;

show the array after each pass of the outer loop of the algorithm completes. &lt; &gt; is a single blank character that is used to pad words with less than 4 characters and it appears before the letter A in alphabetic ordering.

A after the first execution of the loop=

DIG&lt;&gt; DIM&lt;&gt; PINE BORE CATS BATS BITS

A after the second execution of the loop=

DIG&lt;&gt; DIM&lt;&gt; PINE BORE CATS BATS BITS

A after the third execution of the loop=

CATS BATS DIG&lt;&gt; DIM&lt;&gt; PINE BITS BORE

A after the fourth execution of the loop=

BATS BITS BORE CATS DIG&lt;&gt; DIM&lt;&gt; PINE

5. (9 points) Bucket Sort

If length(A)=10 then numbers in the input array in the range [0,0.1) will all go to bucket 0, numbers in the input array in the range [0.1,0.2) will all go to bucket 1, numbers in the input array in the range [0.2,0.3) will all go to bucket 2, numbers in the input array in the range [0.3,0.4) will all go to bucket 3, numbers in the input array in the range [0.4,0.5) will all go to bucket 4, numbers in the input array in the range [0.5,0.6) will all go to bucket 5, numbers in the input array in the range [0.6,0.7) will all go to bucket 6, numbers in the input array in the range [0.7,0.8) will all go to bucket 7, numbers in the input array in the range [0.8,0.9) will all go to bucket 8, and numbers in the input array in the range [0.9,1.0) will all go to bucket 9. If length(A)=9 then list the range of input numbers that will go to buckets 0‚Ä¶8.

State your answers with two decimal digit precision.

Numbers in the input array in the range [0.00, 0.11) will all go to bucket 0

Numbers in the input array in the range [0.11, 0.22) will all go to bucket 1

Numbers in the input array in the range [0.22, 0.33) will all go to bucket 2

Numbers in the input array in the range [0.33, 0.44) will all go to bucket 3

Numbers in the input array in the range [0.44, 0.56) will all go to bucket 4 *without rounding: [0.44, 0.55)

Numbers in the input array in the range [0.56, 0.67) will all go to bucket 5 *without rounding: [0.55, 0.66)

Numbers in the input array in the range [0.67, 0.78) will all go to bucket 6 *without rounding: [0.66, 0.77)

Numbers in the input array in the range [0.78, 0.89) will all go to bucket 7 *without rounding: [0.77, 0.88) Numbers in the input array in the range [0.89, 1.00) will all go to bucket 8 *without rounding: [0.88, 1.00)
